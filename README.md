# Background-Matting

Here i'm providing a solution that can do realtime background matting, that means
it can remove background/blur background/change backgound

## ðŸ“œ DataSet

I have used a library for segmentation after my previous solution was very slow.
In previous solution i used mask rcnn but the end product was very slow.
But i have the dataset that i created, and i have uploaded it to kaggle.

The images were annotated using labelmeV3.16.7
Find it from below link incase if it any use for you
